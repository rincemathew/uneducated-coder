## What is excel?
Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet software from Microsoft that allows users to organize, analyze, and manage data using rows and columns, formulas, pivot tables, and graphs.

Formula Bar - where you enter or view formulas and data.
Name Bar - shows active cell address (B2, C5)
colums - horizontal(1,2,3....)
