## What is excel?
Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet software from Microsoft that allows users to organize, analyze, and manage data using rows and columns, formulas, pivot tables, and graphs. It's widely used for data entry, financial analysis, budgeting, and creating charts and reports in various professional and personal settings. 


## Excel interface
Each excel file we called as 'workbook' and it has multiple 'worksheets' just like pages in a notebook.
Ribbon - is the command bar at the top of the window that provides access to various tools and functions through its tabs, groups, and commands.
Formula Bar - where you enter or view formulas and data.
Name Bar - shows active cell address (B2, C5)
colums - horizontal(1,2,3....)
row - vertical(A,B,C....)
status bar(down right side)-its gives real time info like sum, average, and count when you select numeric data.

## Create table 
select all the items --> insert --> table

## cell reference
1.Relative reference moves with the formula.
eg: =A2+B2
2.absolute reference stays fixed
eg: =$A$2+B2
3.mixed references let you lock eiher the column or the row
eg: column: =$A2+B2
row: =A$2+B2

## formula SUM, AVAERAGE, MIN, MAX
