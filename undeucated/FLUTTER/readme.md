## Scaffold
Scaffold is a fundamental widget that provides a basic structure for a Material Design application's layout. It's a class that offers various APIs and widgets, including an app bar, body, floating action button, drawer, and bottom navigation bar, making it easier to create common app layouts. 
The Scaffold widget takes up the available space on the screen and provides placeholders for various UI elements. You can customize these elements by providing different widgets to the corresponding parameters.
