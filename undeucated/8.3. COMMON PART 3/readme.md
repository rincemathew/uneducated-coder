UTF-8
Unicode is a character set that aims to represent every character from every writing system in the world. UTF-8 is one of the ways to encode these Unicode characters into a format that computers can understand.

Why need of extensions like jpg,psd,png etc because it instructs computer to how to interpreted as follow
8bit is equal to one byte,

Algorithm
Pseudocode
Pseudocode is an informal, high-level description of an algorithm or a program's logic. It uses a combination of natural language (often English) and programming-like constructs, but without adhering to the strict syntax rules of any specific programming language. Its primary purpose is to outline the steps and flow of a process in a way that is easily understandable by humans, regardless of their specific programming language background.

sentinel value
A sentinel value is a special data value used to signal the end of a data structure or to indicate a specific condition in a program, particularly within loops or recursive algorithms. It acts as a marker to tell the program when to stop processing input or to signify a particular state.

data structure
recursion (call function in function)
Recursion is a computer science technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem, breaking it into smaller, self-similar subproblems until a base case is reached, which stops the process

Hexadecimal
Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, using 16 symbols to represent values. These symbols are the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F, where A represents 10, B represents 11, and so on up to F representing 15. It's frequently used in computer science because it provides a concise way to represent binary data. 

pointer
In C programming, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a direct value, a pointer holds the location in memory where a value is stored. This allows for direct manipulation of data in memory and facilitates various advanced programming techniques. 

keepoverflow or buffer overflow
stack overflow
Stack overflow refers specifically to the case when the execution stack grows beyond the memory that is reserved for it. For example, if you call a function which recursively calls itself without termination, you will cause a stack overflow as each function call creates a new stack frame and the stack will eventually consume more memory than is reserved for it.

Buffer overflow refers to any case in which a program writes beyond the end of the memory allocated for any buffer (including on the heap, not just on the stack). For example, if you write past the end of an array allocated from the heap, you've caused a buffer overflow.
