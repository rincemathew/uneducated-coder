Why using this in computer 
Transistors and switches
Unary
UTF-8
Unicode is a character set that aims to represent every character from every writing system in the world. UTF-8 is one of the ways to encode these Unicode characters into a format that computers can understand. 
event driven architecture

Why need of extensions like jpg,psd,png etc because it instructs computer to how to interpreted as follow
8bit is equal to one byte,
Rbg

\n,%s - what is this
Module vs library vs framework
Data type
Int vs bigint data type
integer overflow(why calculations wrong in coding)
assembly language
ram
sentinel value
A sentinel value is a special data value used to signal the end of a data structure or to indicate a specific condition in a program, particularly within loops or recursive algorithms. It acts as a marker to tell the program when to stop processing input or to signify a particular state.
