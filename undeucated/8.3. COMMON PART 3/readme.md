Why using this in computer 
Transistors and switches
Unary
UTF-8
Unicode is a character set that aims to represent every character from every writing system in the world. UTF-8 is one of the ways to encode these Unicode characters into a format that computers can understand. 
event driven architecture
ASCII

Why need of extensions like jpg,psd,png etc because it instructs computer to how to interpreted as follow
8bit is equal to one byte,

sentinel value
A sentinel value is a special data value used to signal the end of a data structure or to indicate a specific condition in a program, particularly within loops or recursive algorithms. It acts as a marker to tell the program when to stop processing input or to signify a particular state.

Hexadecimal
Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, using 16 symbols to represent values. These symbols are the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F, where A represents 10, B represents 11, and so on up to F representing 15. It's frequently used in computer science because it provides a concise way to represent binary data. 

pointer
In C programming, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a direct value, a pointer holds the location in memory where a value is stored. This allows for direct manipulation of data in memory and facilitates various advanced programming techniques.
